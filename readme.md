RPG Game

This is an assignment I did during the first half of the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The point of the assignment was to practice working with CSS animations and jQuery. 

The game features office workers hurling fireballs at each other. The funest part was getting fireballs to fly across the screen and making them increase in size as they do more damage. 

The object of the game is to defeat all other office workers without your health droping to zero. The player's damage doubles with each attack, while the defenders damage remains static.  I chose a different theme. Not much of a theme, really. Just regular looking people throwing fileballs at each other. The order in which you choose the characters matter.
